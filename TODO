TODO
====

* Add user statistics as badges in task list (which task was already
  successfully build for example).
* Add statistics page to view which users have successfully solved what tasks.
  Maybe grade the user by how many tasks they solved?!
* Prevent users from building other users solutions when knowing/guessing their
  entry id.
* Allow users to share solutions with others.
* Allow users to grade solutions by other users.
